 A reproduction of the analysis for Experiment 1 from
 Ella L. James Michael B. Bonsall, Laura Hoppitt, Elizabeth M. Tunbridge, John R. Geddes, Amy L. Milton. 
 
  This report re-produces the analysis of Experiment 1 reported in Ella L.James and John R. Geddes (2015). The data was downloaded from ("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CrumpLab/statisticsLab/master/data/Jamesetal2015Experiment2.csv") 
  
  James et al.(2015) analyzed two trial gatherings, anticipating that a gathering that finished a memory-reactivation task in addition to Tetris amusement play would demonstrate a lower recurrence of meddling recollections of an awful film, compared with a control bunch given no undertakings. The reactivation-in addition to Tetris gathering (n = 26) finished a memory-reactivation task—introduction of 11 film stills pursued by a filler task for 10 min and afterward played Tetris for 12 min. The control gathering (n = 26) was neither given the memory-reactivation task nor played Tetris; rather, after the 10-min filler task, they had a 12-min break in which there was no undertaking. Along these lines, the two gatherings kept on chronicle meddling recollections for 7 (Days 1– 7). they predicted that reconsolidation of a reactivated visual memory of experimental trauma could be disrupted by engaging in a visuospatial task that would compete for visual working memory resources.

## Participants
There were 52 partcipants. 26 per section.  

## Material
The details of the Computer Game Play Reduces Intrusive Memories of Experimental Trauma via Reconsolidation-Update Mechanisms are in the report of James et al(2015). 

## Procedure
This test included three research facility sessions just as the fruition of a pen-and-paper journal at home to record the every day recurrence of meddlesome recollections (both more than 24 hr and after that for an extra 7 days).

```{r include=FALSE}
library(data.table)
#fread("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CrumpLab/statisticsLab/master/data/Jamesetal2015Experiment2.csv")
all_data <- fread("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CrumpLab/statisticsLab/master/data/Jamesetal2015Experiment2.csv")


all_data$Condition <- as.factor(all_data$Condition)
levels(all_data$Condition) <- c("Control",
                                "Reactivation+Tetris", 
                                "Tetris_only",
                                "Reactivation_only")

library(dplyr)

library(ggplot2)

# get means and SEs
descriptive_df <- all_data %>% 
                    group_by(Condition) %>% 
                    summarise(means= mean(Days_One_to_Seven_Number_of_Intrusions),
                              SEs = sd(Days_One_to_Seven_Number_of_Intrusions)/sqrt(length(Days_One_to_Seven_Number_of_Intrusions)))

aov(Days_One_to_Seven_Number_of_Intrusions ~ Condition, all_data)

```


# Results
Means for each subject in each conditon in a one factor (Control vs Reactivation Plus Tetris ) before intervention and ((Tetris only and Reactivation only) vs Control) after intervention.

Were submitted to a one factor ANOVA. Means results are displayed in Table 1 and Figure 1. The full ANOVA table is reported in Table 2. 


# Discussion
The re-analysis successfully reproduced the reported James et al. 

We presented the mean nosy recollections for the week from each subject in each condition to a one-factor between subjects ANOVA, with Intervention type (No-task control, Reactivation Plus tetris, Tetris just, Reactivation just) as the sole free factor. We found a primary impact of Intervention type, F(3, 68) = 3.79, MSE = 10.09, p = 0.014. Mean meddlesome recollections were essentially extraordinary between the Control (M = 5.11, SE = .99), Reactivation in addition to Tetris (M = 3.89, SE = .68), Tetris just (M= 3.89, SE = .68), and Reactivation just (M = 4.83, .78) conditions
